# Note-Taker-Express
challenge 11

## Description
The Note-Taker app is a backend project designed to create and delete notes. The project uses express.js to be able to send get, post and delete requests to a localhost server. Starter coded was given in order to begin inputting the routes and requests needed. Through this project process, I learned about how to create GET and POST requests and had the opprotunity to look into DELET request all using the CRUD model.
